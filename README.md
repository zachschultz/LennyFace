# LennyFace
Simple website to easily copy Lenny Faces to your clipboard.

Uses the following technologies:
- ZClip (http://www.steamdev.com/zclip/) - used to automatically copy selection to user's clipboard.
  - Doesn't work on mobile devices, so it just uses a workaround to select all of the text a user clicks, then lets them copy it on their own.
- Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) - you know.
- jQuery (http://www.jquery.com/) - you also know.
- Knockout.js (http://knockoutjs.com/) - JavaScript library to make dynamic applications. Extremely unnecessary in the scope of this application but I am trying to learn how to write better and more organizaed JavaScript.
